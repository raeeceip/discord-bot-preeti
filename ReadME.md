- This is Preeti, a Discord bot written in Python using the discord.py library.
- She was made to do a lot of things, but she's still a work in progress.
- Shes currently in the process of being rebuilt, so some things may not work as intended.
- She can be found on the [Discord Bots](https://discordbots.org/bot/966103472074281070) website.

## Commands

- Preeti was made to be a multipurpose bot designed to help cheer my best friend up on her birthday, so she has one main command, "How pretty am I today?" that returns a random compliment.

### She has a few other commands, most of which are still being worked on.

- `!help` - Shows this message.
- 'joke' - Tells a joke
- 'quote' - Sends an inspirational quote
- 'meme' - Sends a meme
- 'cow joke' - Sends a random cow joke from jokes.txt
- She also has a few other commands on the way, along with some other helpful friends :), but they're still being worked on.
